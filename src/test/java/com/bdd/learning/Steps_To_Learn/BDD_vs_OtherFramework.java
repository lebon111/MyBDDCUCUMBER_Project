	//In BDD Cucumber we do not create Test cases, rather we create Test Scenarios, so no @Test or any kind of TestNG annotation
	// Be very careful with the .feature file
	// Understand where to use Cucumber Expressions and where to use Regular Expressions
	// If you are using Cucumber expressions, do not forget to use ^ as Starting and $ as Ending for that Step
	//We do not recommend Excel for data driven, rather we use Scenario Outline: and Examples
	//Cucumber reports we can get it in the Runner file as a Cucumber Option
	//If you want to run Maven Test then change the name of The Runner Class to something with Test_Runner
	//We generally do not use Inheritance concept (sometimes we might but not like TestBase in Hybrid Framework)
	//Try to create Classes (Utilitarian Classes and methods to work around)
